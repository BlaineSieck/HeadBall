# HeadBall

**Team Members**

Gabriel Costanzo (Team Leader) - falling objects and collision control    
Blaine Sieck - facial recognition and menu

**Functionality**

- Main menu will have a start button and a quit button
- Once you press start you will be prompted to back up if you are too close to the camera
- Once correctly positioned, there will be a countdown timer before the game starts
- A soccer ball will fall from the top of the screen and your goal is to bounce it off your head and continue to do so while avoiding other falling objects
- If one of the falling objects hits you or you drop the soccer ball the game will end and your score will be displayed on the screen

**Implementation**
- we have looked into the facial recognition API
- discussed physics of falling objects
- no code written yet

**Plan Moving Forward**
- implement the above ideas

# User Study

**Task Description**  
- the user will move around in order to bounce the ball on their head (in this case for the demo, the facial recognition is not yet linked to the ball collisions, so a placeholder box will also be displayed and can be controlled by the user manually to bounce the ball)

**Hypothesis**  
- the task is very straight forward and there is no real way to fail or misunderstand so we believe users will have no trouble grasping our demo and realizing what the finished product could look like
