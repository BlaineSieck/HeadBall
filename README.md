# HeadBall

**Team Members**

Gabriel Costanzo (Team Leader) - falling objects and collision control    
Blaine Sieck - facial recognition and menu

**Functionality**

- Main menu will have a start button and a quit button
- Once you press start you will be prompted to back up if you are too close to the camera
- Once correctly positioned, there will be a countdown timer before the game starts
- A soccer ball will fall from the top of the screen and your goal is to bounce it off your head and continue to do so while avoiding other falling objects
- If one of the falling objects hits you or you drop the soccer ball the game will end and your score will be displayed on the screen
